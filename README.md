# 🌍 Hello World in Many Languages

Welcome to the **Hello World Multilingual Showcase**—a curated collection of executable “Hello, World!” snippets across a variety of programming languages. Each file is named by language (e.g., `python.py`, `go.go`) and alphabetically organized into folders (`p/`, `g/`, etc.) for instant clarity.

Whether you're a polyglot dev, a curious learner, or just here for the syntax vibes — this repo is for you.

## 🤝 Contribute

Want to add a new language or improve an existing snippet?

- Add your `[language].[ext]` file

Please avoid adding `.gitignore`, `README.md` and similar files to the alphabetical folders—these are excluded by design.

## 🧼 Maintainers

This repo is curated for clarity, modularity, and remixability. All snippets are executable and minimal — no boilerplate, no fluff.

Happy hacking! 💻
